# Chapter audit tracker (ch2–ch58)

Working notes for the batch audit producing `data/fixes/chN_audit.json`
files. Apply each with
`flask apply-fixes data/fixes/chN_audit.json --apply` on ambrose
(removal ops prompt an extra confirm). Files are independent and
idempotent — order doesn't matter, duplicates no-op.

Audit checks per chapter: false-positive character associations
(substring keyword matches), wrong-person keywords, missing
location/event associations, event keywords that never match the prose,
relationships stated in prose but missing, and chapter-character
summaries (add missing / rewrite thin ones).

## Relationship type ids (verified live 2026-07-12)

Parent/Child=1, Husband/Wife=3, Sworn Brother=4, Sibling=5, Cousin=7,
Pibling/Nibling=10, Grandparent/Grandchild=14,
Great-Grandparent/Grandchild=16, Ancestor/Descendant=18.
No adoptive/step/liege types exist — note adoptive ties in `_note` on a
Parent/Child op (ch1 did this for Cao Teng→Cao Song).

## Report-only findings (need manual action, no apply-fixes op exists)

From ch45:
- **The ancient music master Shi Kuang (師曠) has no Character row** —
  Zhou Yu cites him in ch45; the existing Shi Kuang [1956, 士匡] is Shi
  Xie's Eastern Wu general, a different person. Create the musician row
  + associate to ch45 if wanted (the fix file removes the wrong-person
  association).

From ch41:
- **Zhang Zi [3794] duplicates Zhang Yi [3757]** — same surrendered Yuan
  general (B-T spells him "Zhang Zi"; 3757's ch32/33 keywords already use
  that spelling). ch41_audit swaps the association to 3757; soft-delete
  3794 via the admin UI after applying.

From ch38:
- **Sun Yi [2121] and Zhang Wen [3219] carried "(duplicate record)" as
  their ch38 summaries** — the fix file replaces the text, but the
  underlying duplicate rows (whichever they mirror) still need a manual
  merge/soft-delete check via the admin duplicates page.

From ch33:
- **Peng An has no Character row** — Yuan Tan's champion, slain by Xu
  Huang in a few bouts before Nanpi (ch33 ¶44). Create + associate to
  ch33 if wanted.

From ch1:
- "Yuan Mountains" (ch1 ¶6 omen scene) has no Location row — create via
  admin UI + associate if wanted.
- ~~Liu Bei's father needs a Character row~~ DONE — Ren created Liu
  Hong [3849]. Five OTHER Liu Hong rows exist (1351–1355); 1352 (Jin,
  Zhongjia) vs 1353 (bare "Han politician") look like possible dupes.

From ch2:
- **Liu Xian [3601] is a duplicate of Liu Xie [1434]** — created from
  ch2's "Liu Xian" spelling of the future Emperor Xian. After applying
  ch2_audit.json it has no chapters; soft-delete it via the admin UI.
- **Liang Da [1263] cleanup is multi-chapter.** His alias 'Tai'
  false-matched every "X Tai" name (Zhou Tai, Chen Tai, Zheng Tai...),
  giving him 21 bogus chapter associations + book_mention_count 106 +
  a Koei portrait of Taigong Wang(!). ch2_audit.json fixes the global
  alias ('Tai' → 'Liang Tai') and removes the ch2 association. In-range
  chapters (15, 44, 48, 49, 51, 55) get checked as their audits come
  up; OUT-OF-RANGE chapters still carrying the bogus association +
  'Liang Da,Tai' keywords: 61, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 82, 83, 84, 107,
  109, 110, 111, 114. The portrait should also be reviewed manually.
- "Jiedu" (Liu Chang's fief, ¶81) has no Location row.
- Event "Massacre of the Eunuchs" [11] is associated to ch2 but never
  inline-tags (the massacre itself is ch3; ch2 is the plotting). Left
  associated on purpose — sidebar context. ch3_audit.json adds it to
  ch3 too.

From ch29:
- **Duplicate Lu Fan rows**: Lü Fan [1554] (Sun Ce's adviser since
  ch15) vs Lu Fan [3742] (proposes Yu Ji's rain wager, ch29) — same
  man 呂範. Merge via admin UI.

From ch20:
- **Duplicate Emperor Jing rows**: ch1 used Liu Qi [3590]; ch20
  associates Liu Qi [3586] (kw 'Emperor Jing') — same emperor, two
  rows. The applied ch1 relationship (3590 → Liu Sheng) sits on the
  other row. Merge via admin UI.

From ch15:
- Yan Yu [2794] carried the literal summary "(duplicate record)" — find
  and merge its twin (another 嚴輿 row).

From ch14:
- Cao Bao's daughter is Lü Bu's wife ("my son-in-law... Lu Bu") — again
  blocked by the missing in-law relationship type.
- "Yewang" (Yang Feng's camp, ¶4) has no Location row.

From ch13:
- **Duplicate Yang Feng rows**: [2816] (associated to ch13) carried the
  literal summary "(duplicate record; same person - see 2815)". Merge /
  soft-delete one. Same for **Zhang Ji [3134]** whose summary was
  "(duplicate record)" — find its twin (likely another 張濟/張既 row).
- Empress He [831] was associated to ch13 via bare 'Empress' keyword —
  she died in ch4; ch13's empress is Fu Shou [578]. Fixed in the file.
- Dongjian, Dayang, Shanbei (flight waypoints) have no Location rows.

From ch10:
- **Duplicate Liu Xiu rows**: ch6 associates Liu Xiu [3577], ch10
  associates Liu Xiu [1438] — both are the Latter Han founder. Merge /
  soft-delete one via admin UI.

From ch7:
- Cai Mao is Liu Biao's brother-in-law (stated twice) — no in-law
  relationship type exists (same gap as Dong Zhuo's sons-in-law).
- Sun Jian's two wives (Lady Wu and her sister) are unnamed in ch7
  prose; Lady Wu [2450] left unassociated — no usable needle.
- Location aliases are single-word for many rows ('Wen', 'Shang',
  'You', 'Ji', 'Jing') — these are the root cause of the location
  false-positive associations seen in ch2/ch3. Worth an eventual
  sweep, but per-chapter keywords are the safe fix for now.

From ch6:
- Liu Xie's ch6 keyword 'Emperor' also matches "the First Emperor" (Qin
  Shi Huang) 4× and "the Emperor's mother" in the seal-lore flashback
  (¶69–70) — needs per-snippet MatchExclusions via
  /admin/chapter-associations; a keyword change would lose the many
  legit "the Emperor" mentions.
- "Fan Chong" (Red Eyebrows leader, ¶19) has no Character row — minor.
- Kuai Liang ↔ Kuai Yue sibling relationship deferred until a chapter
  whose prose states it.

From ch5:
- "Liangdong" (Sun Jian's fallback camp, ¶60) has no Location row.
- Li Feng's [1160] keyword set includes 'Anguo' (likely his courtesy
  name) — it false-matches "Wu Anguo"; only ch5 affected (Wu Anguo
  appears nowhere else).

From ch4 (and the sex sweep):
- **data/fixes/sex_audit.json** fixes sex=female on 73 characters (every
  Empress/Lady/Consort row, Diao Chan, Da/Xiao Qiao, Cai Yan, Fu Shou,
  Lü Zhi, Sun Ren, Duan Qiaoxiao). Apply it early — relationship labels
  (Mother/Daughter/Wife) resolve from Character.sex.
- Possible duplicate female rows to eyeball: Empress Bian [33] vs Lady
  Bian [35]; Empress Zhen [3344] vs Lady Zhen [3345]; Lady Wuyang
  [3608] vs Lady of Wuyang [2502] (2502 is the one associated to ch2).
- No Location row for the inn / Chenggao hamlet needed; nothing missing.

From ch3:
- No "in-law" relationship type exists. Ch3 states Niu Fu and Li Ru are
  both Dong Zhuo's sons-in-law — worth a Parent-in-law/Child-in-law
  type if wanted; skipped for now.
